## Abstract
This experience report introduces a novel, adaptable course-based undergraduate research (CURE) model designed to nurture research interest in undergraduate CS majors. Traditional CURE models often target specific disciplines. Our model allows students to explore research questions within their chosen CS subfields. A pilot study assessed the model's effectiveness. Undergraduate CS majors participated, completing pre- and post-course surveys to gauge research motivation. The course culminated in a final research project requiring students to delve into a specific CS area, propose a novel approach, and outline a research plan. Findings from this pilot will inform the model's refinement for wider implementation. Further, the developed materials are shared openly here.
